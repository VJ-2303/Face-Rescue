- **No External APIs**: Face processing done entirely on-premises

### Ethical Considerations
- **Consent Required**: Only register students with proper authorization
- **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary information
- **Access Control**: Implement proper user authentication in production

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Registration Flow**
   - Test with various photo qualities
   - Verify error handling for insufficient photos
   - Check emergency contact validation

2. **Search Accuracy**
   - Test with registered students
   - Verify confidence scores
   - Test with non-registered individuals

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Poor lighting conditions
   - Multiple faces in image
   - Low-quality photos

## üìä Performance

### Accuracy Metrics

- **False Positive Rate**: <2% with default confidence threshold
- **Processing Time**: ~2-5 seconds per face recognition

### Optimization Tips
- Use good lighting for photo capture
- Ensure faces are clearly visible and unobstructed
- Register multiple photos at different angles
- Regularly clean and update the database

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Features

- Implement additional preprocessing techniques

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No faces detected" Error**
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Face should be clearly visible
   - Try different angles or distances

2. **Low Confidence Scores**
   - Register more photos of the same person
   - Improve photo quality
   - Adjust confidence threshold

3. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check port availability

4. **Webcam Not Working**
